Module reloading
- When reloading a module which creates objects then the old
  objects should possibly be destroyed
- Methods doesn't seem to be reloaded, look into this
- Figure out how objects move on collision

- Why is tick-object the list to be in to recieve keyboard events?
- What is event-objects for then?

- All the {event,tick,draw}-lists should have some way to
  ensure that the same objects isn't put there multiple times 

- I use `#:init-value (func)' in a few places. Can this cause
  issues if the fields of the created objects are modified.
  Since all instances of the class possibly share the object

- with-new-scene definitions isn't found by ctags

- ss-inspector should be extended to support non-rectangular
  and non-regular sprites.
