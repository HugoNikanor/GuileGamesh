#| TODO
 | Quite a lot of stuff here should be out-macro'd
 |
 | - defining the scene should possibly be implicit
 | - everything below being in the scene can be prettier
 | - Class declarations should possibly not be in a scene
 | - Instead have some nice way of handling classes connected to scenes
 | - Propper way of only loading some stuff the first time the
 |   scene is loaded.
 | - Clear way to mark stuff that should be reloaded
 |#

#| Secound TODO
 | I don't want to recreate the objects in the
 | scene on reload. But I want to update them
 | to contain everything new. This is possibly
 | done automaticly. Otherwise something like
 | a class replace should suffice.
